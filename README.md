# Sostelar A.C. website

## Backgroudn
Sostelar A.C. is an NGO operating in Monterrey, Mexico, who helps women who have been a victim of violence through workshops about ethics, finance and psicology.
Through one of my university's social service groups called ThunderMX, my team and I designed and developed a website for this NGO.
